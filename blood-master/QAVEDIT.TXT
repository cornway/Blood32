QavEdit, formerly AnimEdit, has undergone a complete overhaul.  The QAV engine
now uses a different metaphor to create and display animations.  It is now
based on fixed frames intervals, with a fixed number of layers (currently 8).
This means that it is much easier to control the z-ordering of tiles, and
simple to adjust the overall speed of playback.

You should convert all existing QAVs with the command line:

	QAVEDIT -c path\*.QAV
