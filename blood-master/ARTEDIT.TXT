VIEW

	Single view objects do not change their view based on the players
	position.  In other words, they look the same no matter how you look
	at them.  This works best for objects with radial symtetry, such as
	pillars, cauldrons, torchiere lamps, etc.

	5 view objects offer 8 different angles of view by x-flipping certain
	of the views to take advantage of bilateral symetry.  The views
	represented in the art are 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees.  Views
	for 225, 270, and 315 are created by x-flipping 135, 90, and 45
	respectively.

	8 view objects have unique views for each of the 8 viewing octants.

	5 half view objects are a special case of 8 way views for objects
	which are flush against a wall.  For these objects, it is not
	possible to view them from behind the wall, so the 3 rear views are
	skipped.  Views of 0, 45, 90, 270, and 315 are represented.  This
	mode works well for sconces, clocks, relief ornaments, etc.

This document created.

Don't move around anything but creature view/animation tiles, since tile
changes cannot yet be applied to maps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
95/06/24

Added multiple do/undo capabilities.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
95/07/11

Added view type description above.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
95/08/21

Changed the way extended tile selection works in the tile pick view.  The
selected range now goes to the upper end - 1, which means you can now
create an empty selection.  The catch is that you can't select the highest
tile, but this shouldn't be a big problem.

Tile origin adjustments are now applied to the selected range of tiles, which
means you can easily adjust the origin for an entire animation.

Changed keys which set origin to the edge and center to use Ctrl instead of
Shift in order to have a more orthogonal key mapping.  Get it?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
95/10/25

Added ability to modify tile surface types with the S key

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
96/01/17

Added ability to modify tile names with the N key. This does NOT work
in conjunction with tile movement yet.
